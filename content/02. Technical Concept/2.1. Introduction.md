# Design and development principles

The general approach on design of architecture for the UNCITRAL-OpenDigitalProcurement combines the concepts of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Event Driven Architecture (EDA) to achieve a richer, more robust model by leveraging previously unknown causal relationships in order to build a new event pattern. This new pattern triggers further automated processing that adds exponential value to the enterprise by injecting value-added information into the recognized pattern which could not have been previously achieved.
